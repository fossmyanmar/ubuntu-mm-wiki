##Recognizing Win98 machines

Microsoft networking is extremely quirky. To enable recognition of PCs with Windows 98, edit your Samba configuration file:

	sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Then add the following lines to the file:

	[global]
	# THE LANMAN FIX
	client lanman auth = yes
	client ntlmv2 auth = no

##Samba server

[Samba](http://www.samba.org/) provides file/print services for the SMB/CIFS protocol used in Windows-based networks. See the [official Ubuntu documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/13.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html) for more information about providing services in a Windows network. A Samba server can be installed using the tasksel option during installation of the Ubuntu [server](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Trusty_Servers#Servers) from the LiveCD, or at any time using:

sudo tasksel install samba-server

    An alternative method of installation is: 

sudo apt-get install samba samba-tools system-config-samba smbfs

    Note: samba-tools, system-config-samba, and smbfs are optional. 

    Modify Samba settings. 

        Method 1: 

    Menu -> System -> Administration -> Samba 
    (Note: this is available only if you installed system-config-samba.) 

It is recommended that your user be a member of the sambashare [group](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Trusty_User_Administration#Users_and_Groups), as well.

        Method 2: 

    Enable File Sharing Server With User Login (Very Reliable Method) 

    Do the following on the machine that has the files to be shared: 

            Add current user to Samba: 

sudo smbpasswd -a username

        (replacing username with your login username) 

            Open the samba config file: 

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

            Add the directories to be added (right at the end) in the following format: 

[Pictures]
path = /home/username/<folder_to_be_shared>

        (Replace username with your username and <folder_to_be_shared> with the folder you want to share) 

        Press CTRL+X and then Y to save. 

            Restart Samba: 

sudo service smbd restart
sudo service nmbd restart

            Note: Prior versions used: 

sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart

    On Windows access the folder in the following format in Windows Explorer: 

\\192.168.x.x

        (replace 192.168.x.x with the actual IP address of your server which is serving the folder) 

    On Linux type the following in Konqueror or Nautilus: 

smb://192.168.x.x

        (replace 192.168.x.x with the actual IP address of your server serving the folder) 

Note: If you use Sharing in KDE's System Settings panel, be aware that there is a small bug, reported here. In brief, you need to comment out/delete any instances of these two lines in /etc/smb.conf :

case sensitive
msdfs proxy

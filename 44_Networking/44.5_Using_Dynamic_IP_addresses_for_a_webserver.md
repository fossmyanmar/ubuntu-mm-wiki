##Using Dynamic IP addresses for a webserver

Normally, domain name servers (DNS) that are used publicly on the Internet match a web server's URL name with the IP address of the server's host computer. If your computer has a static IP address, then you can publish your own web server's URL as belonging to the static, unchanging IP address of your computer.

However, if your IP address is dynamic (always changing) because you use an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that constantly changes your IP address (using DHCP), then you will need a Dynamic DNS service to constantly keep track of your dynamically changing IP address and match it to of your web server's URL. Fortunately, there are a few Dynamic DNS services that will do this for you, either for a small fee or even for free. For more info, see this Ubuntu Community help article.

For specific tips on setting up Dynamic DNS, see this [article](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dynamic_IP_servers).

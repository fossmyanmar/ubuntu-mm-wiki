##Wicd Network Manager##

[Wicd Network Manager](http://wicd.sourceforget.net/) is a GTK -dependent networking manager written in Python that can be used in all variants of Ubuntu. Many users (including me) report it 
to be faster and more stable than Network Manager. To avoid networking conflicts, Wicd
requires the removal of Network Manager prior to installation.

	sudo apt-get remove network-manager
	sudo reboot
	sudo apt-get install wicd

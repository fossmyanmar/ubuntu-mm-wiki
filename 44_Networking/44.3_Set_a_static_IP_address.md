##Set a static IP address##

I have never been able to ger Network Manager to accept my static IP address settings. If you 
only use only a wire interface, you do not neekd a network manager and it can be removed.

-Remove Network Manager:

	sudo apt-get remove network-manager
	sudo reboots

-Edit the /etc /network/interfaces files:

##Set a static IP address

Set a static IP address

    Precise Pangolin (12.04 LTS) is the first version of (K)Ubuntu in which I have been able to get Network Manager to accept my static IP address settings (for both wired and wireless connections). 

    Network Manager -> Manage Connections... -> connection -> Edit... -> IPv4 address -> Method: Manual -> IP Address: 192.168.0.111 -> Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 -> Gateway: 192.168.0.1 -> OK 

    I also add the DNS servers I like to use (I don't use the DNS servers of my ISP for security reasons). 

    If you only use only a wired interface, you do not need a network manager and it can be removed if desired. Doing so requires configuring the networking settings manually. 

        In Precise, Network Manager does not need to be removed if manual settings are used in /etc/network/interfaces. To allow the settings to take effect (and the network connection to be "unmanaged" by Network Manager), edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf: 

sudo kate /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

and change the following section so that it reads false:

[ifupdown]
managed=false

Then restart Network Manager:

sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart

        Edit the /etc/network/interfaces file (use the gedit text editor instead of kate if using Ubuntu instead of Kubuntu): 

sudo kate /etc/network/interfaces

        and replace the line (ok if line is missing) 

iface eth0 inet dhcp

        with the following lines (using your own LAN settings and desired DNS-nameservers, of course): 

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.35
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.0.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1
dns-nameservers 8.26.56.26 208.67.222.222 8.20.247.20 208.67.220.220 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

        Then restart networking: 

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

        Check to see if your settings are now correct: 

ifconfig

    The Wicd network manager also allows a wireless connection to have a static IP. 

    In versions prior to Precise Pangolin (12.04 LTS) I was not able to get Network Manager to accept my static IP address settings. If you only use only a wired interface, you do not need a network manager and it can be removed. 

    Remove Network Manager (replace network-manager-kde with network-manager if using Ubuntu instead of Kubuntu): 

sudo apt-get remove network-manager-kde
sudo reboot

    Edit the /etc/network/interfaces file (use the gedit text editor instead of kate if using Ubuntu instead of Kubuntu): 

sudo kate /etc/network/interfaces

    and replace the line (ok if line is missing) 

iface eth0 inet dhcp

    with the following lines (using your own LAN settings, of course): 

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.35
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.0.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1

    Then restart networking: 

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

    Check to see if your settings are now correct: 

ifconfig

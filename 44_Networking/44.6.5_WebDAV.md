##WebDAV

[WebDAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) is a method for allowing remote access to local folders via an HTTP-based web browser or file manager. This can be combined with user authentication (using LDAP or other password mechanism).

See [this page](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/WebDAV) for instructions.
